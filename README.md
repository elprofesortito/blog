I am Spanish teacher at Hyde Park High School attempting to teach in a innovative and dynamic way.
I will be leveraging my software engineering, data analysis, and polyglot background in the following ways:

1. Grading Automation
2. Tracking Student Progress
3. Teaching with immersive and engaging ways such as TPRS, real-life projects, and comprehensible input.
